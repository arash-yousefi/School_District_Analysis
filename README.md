# School_District_Analysis
## Deliverable 5: Make Comparisons Between District and Charter Schools
I noticed 2 problems
- 1- When it's asking for total number of students at each school, I have no idea how to add " student_number" in stead of id becase student number is not part of the dataset
- 2- In the result for "Average math score by grade for each school type" showed the grades are rounded so I used the round function to solve this issue.
